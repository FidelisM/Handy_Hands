                    <p>Overnight care is about knowing someone is there to help if a loved one needs fluids, snacks, or
                        help using the restroom. Itâ€™s perfect for people who have trouble sleeping through the night or
                        tend to wake up disoriented.
                        With overnight care, a caregiver comes by the house to provide a few hours of care before bed
                        and in the morning.</p>
                    <p>In addition to providing homemaking and companionship services, overnight
                        caregivers can provide a number of personal care services, including but not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bathing</li>
